# au-revoir-gmail

Notes on migrating away from a gmail.com email address.

It's a process that is best done gradually. The most useful thing you can do is sign up for a password manager (I enjoy 1Password), so that you have all your logins in one place.

## Securing the longevity of your new email address



## Alternatives to Gmail

Paid alternatives to Gmail that respect your privacy:

* FastMail
* ProtonMail

## Specific aspects

### Git & GitHub

If you've been working with Git, chances are your gmail address is embedded in all your commits. Changing a (possibly public) repository's history is not feasible in most cases, so assume that loss and change your git config to use your new email address going forward.

```bash
TODO add git command
```

If you're using GitHub, you'll need to keep the gmail address around as a secondary email. Otherwise, all commits signed with your gmail address will get disconnected from your GitHub profile. 

### Apple ID

TBD.

__You'll still be keeping your Gmail account around__ for a while, _just in case_.
